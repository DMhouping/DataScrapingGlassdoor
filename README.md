<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Download the SeleniumGlassdor.py file. Change the path of the chromedriver on your machine. Use your own file that contain the lists of the companies glassdoor url. The company url csv file is also attached here. The way to generate the file is also based on selenium, searching the 'glassdoor' + company name in google search engine, and extract the url from the first results. Per requests, I can also upload the file accordingly.

### Prerequisites

Install the selenium before using it.
* selenium
  ```sh
  pip install selenium
  ```

## For the other sections
If you want to scape data from the other sections, such as jobs, salaries. You can use the following methods to first extract the url and then use the similar method to downlode the sections.

* reviewsUrl = browser.find_element_by_xpath("//a[@data-label='Reviews']").get_attribute('href')
* jobsUrl = browser.find_element_by_xpath("//a[@data-label='Jobs']").get_attribute('href')
* salariesUrl = browser.find_element_by_xpath("//a[@data-label='Salaries']").get_attribute('href')
* interviewsUrl = browser.find_element_by_xpath("//a[@data-label='InterÂ­views']").get_attribute('href')
* benefitsUrl = browser.find_element_by_xpath("//a[@data-label='Benefits']").get_attribute('href')
* photosUrl = browser.find_element_by_xpath("//a[@data-label='Photos']").get_attribute('href')
